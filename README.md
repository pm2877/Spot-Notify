Notifications and more for Spotify App on Mac OS.

- This project provides a script that shows desktop notifications on _Mac OS_ that will contain name, artist, album, and other details of the song when the user starts playing or changes a song when using the Spotify Application.

- Users can select to Skip the song by clicking the Skip button in the notification.

- Clicking on the notification opens the Spotify Application.

- The project also aims to provide various shortcuts for Spotify to help users use various functionalities of the Spotify App without having to change their window while working.
